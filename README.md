# YQuantum-QuantumRings-Shor

## Overview
This repository focuses on quantum computing projects, particularly the implementation and exploration of Shor's Algorithm and quantum ring simulations. The main goal is to utilize quantum computers for efficient prime factorization using Shor's Algorithm.

## Features
- **Shor's Algorithm**: Implementation and simulation of prime factorization.
- **Quantum Ring Models**: Simulations and analyses of specific quantum systems.
- **Quantum Gate Operations**: Implementation using frameworks like Qiskit.

## Requirements
This project does not yet support `qiskit 2.0`. Please ensure you install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
